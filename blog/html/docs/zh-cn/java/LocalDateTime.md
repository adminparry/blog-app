> LocalDateTime

LocalDateTime is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time, often viewed as year-month-day-hour-minute-second. Other date and time fields, such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed. Time is represented to nanosecond precision. For example, the value "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a LocalDateTime.
This class does not store or represent a time-zone. Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays, combined with the local time as seen on a wall clock. It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information such as an offset or time-zone.
The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time. For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable. However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
This is a value-based class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality (==), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of LocalDateTime may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The equals method should be used for comparisons.
